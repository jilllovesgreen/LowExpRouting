The original coordinates are in latitude and longitude. But it was converted to UTM 10N by mistake.
The coordinates should be converted back to latitdue and longitude with UTM '10N'. Please double check if the range of coordinates should shown in Riverside area.
Then convert the lat & long to UTM 11S.
